# {{ site.course.number }} Initial Schedule: Subject to Change

## Office Hours

I will be available Wednesdays after class and by appointment via our Google Plus community.

## Work in Progress
This schedule is a work in progress and will change based on our progress, your interests, and things that come up along the way.  I'll make sure to announce any changes in our Google community.

## Guest Speakers

We’ll have a series of programming professionals come in and discuss their experiences and their personal relationships to the topics we’re covering.  A selection of speakers who have confirmed (but not yet scheduled):

* Brian Marks, CTO, Trinket.io

* Karen Cranston, co-PI, Open Tree of Life Project

* Julia Elman, Lead Designer, Trinket.io

* Alan Dipert, (Currently) Freelance Programmer

* Jeff Heard, Senior Researcher, RENCI

### <date d="20140108">January 8th, Week 1: Digging into Source Code</date>

Key Questions

* What is Text?

* What is a Computer?

* How Can Text Control Computers?

1. None (first day of class)

In-Class: Get set up on Google Plus

In-Class: Get set up on Github

In-Class Exercise: Modify the class blog

* In-Class Exercise: Write an initial blog post

* In-Class Exercise: Open your first issue

* In-Class Exercise: Close your first issue

* Note: As we’ll learn, `git` is an open source command line version control system.  Github.com is the fastest growing `git` repository on the internet.  This distinction isn’t always immediately apparent.

### <date d="20140115">January 15th, Week 2: Hello Python</date>

Key Questions

* How do I control Python code?

Readings: 

* [Think Python Chapter on Turtle](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/helloturtle.html)
* Software Carpentry: [Computational Thinking](http://software-carpentry.org/4_0/softeng/principles.html) - This is intended as a wrap-up essay but I often find it useful to ‘start at the end’.  Use the essay to orient yourself to concepts that we’ll be learning.


Read the text, do the exercises, and be prepared to explore what Turtles can do in class.  The videos are optional- I find them less helpful than the text myself but you might find them helpful.  Pay attention to the Flow of Control exercises

* In-Class Exercise: Write a simple post with syntax highlighting and a screenshot of your turtle program.
